            In 1976, there were two individuals with the names of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, who came up with the
            product idea for Apple. The introduction of this new technology put the world in awe with its stunning new 
            visuals and innovations which set new standards for user interactivity and impacted the world of new generation 
            technology. By creating new ways of how phones and computers are developed this made a breakthrough in modern
            technology, which helped kickstart this company with a massive lead on other companies competitors. The new uses 
            came after bringing the first GUIs into adoption for handheld computers, which allowed them to bring new aesthetics 
            to the phone and make it more personal preferences for the customer in how they wanted their phone to look and act.

            Throughout the years 1977 and 1978 Apple became incorporated making it an official business
            through legal means. During this time they have made it through the early stages of development
            with the expertise of many professionals, specifically Markkula, They were able to come up with
            Apple II. This was the first distributed microcomputer. This computer had capabilities of
            sound, graphics (colored), and television plug-in capabilities. Its design and plastic casing
            were the very big selling point of the product giving it the base price of $1,298. This was able
            to make it into the hands of about 6 million users and made it a very successful step forward for Apple.

            1979 Introduced something used every day in modern computers, the Graphical User Interface(GUI).
            While the GUI was a newly introduced innovation another game-breaking innovation was the mouse another
            thing very common in today's world. The development of the GUI and mouse played a key role in the development
            of the Apple Macintosh later on. The idea was to create personal computers for different audiences that were 
            low-cost, user-friendly easier to use than Apple Lisa which was more geared to target professionals.

            Apple was a very reputable brand known for its key innovations and game-changing products
            that have shaped the modern world. The company was able to net over $100 million by 1980 with
            more than 1,000 employees. By the end of 1980, it was able to reach $2 billion valuation which
            was greater than Ford which at the time had one of the highest valuations in its time. Although the Macintosh
            was a massive success this didn't stop other companies from trying to accomplish something greater.
            IBM entered the PC market(1981) by launching its version of personal computers. These computers would instead
            have readily available hardware and software that would be included with the PC as well as having their microprocessor
            from Intel. After seeing this, Apple developed the Macintosh(1984) and was shown in a Super Bowl XVIII commercial,
            which appealed to many users for its price and user-friendly GUI. This helped Apple make it back to the top
            of the market and stay as successful as it had always been.

            After many years since the release of Apple computers, now looking more towards
            new products and greater innovation in 1997 and 2010 Steve Jobs returned
            as the CEO of Apple looked over, and greatly contributed to the development of new
            software and products such as the iMac, iTunes, iPod, and the iPad. Once the shift
            to emphasizing Apple products as more minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing this has
            Apple's consumer and educational appeal. First, the iMac became a best-selling Mac. Then
            iTunes was introduced to store and organize audio files in MP3 format which was later
            used for the iPod which also became the market leader. Lastly, the iPhone/iPad was introduced
            with capabilities for playing videos, audio files, as well as accessing the internet. This
            innovation brought on one of Apple's best by including functionalities never seen before such as
            Multi-touch screens, combining text and email, compatibility with Mac computers, and creating the
            Apple ecosystem to extend capabilities beyond these devices.

            Now looking past these innovations that put Apple in a great standing, it was time to look
            at improving what was already made and creating small new additions to Apple's ecosystem.
            This allowed for many generations of iPhones to be created along with the development of Siri in 2011.
            A new variety of iPads have come to light such as the iPad Mini(the smaller version of the iPad) in 2012
            and the iPad Pro(the larger version of the iPad) in 2015. By 2014 Apple was able to introduce Apple Pay which
            allowed for ATM cards to be stored digitally. The Apple Watch(2015) was created which gave wearable
            technology with new tracking software. AirPods were released in 2016 and became a top seller due to their 
            usefulness for being wireless. Then the HomePad was brought on to compete with Amazon's Alexa. The popularity of 
            Apple since the early stages was what kick-started and nurtured current technology in today's world
            and made many new ways of living for people around the world. As they are one of the current industry
            leaders they continue to develop and release new software that impacts people's everyday lives now.
